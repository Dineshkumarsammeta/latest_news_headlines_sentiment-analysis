# SECURITY POLICY

Thank you for helping keep this project secure. This document explains which versions we support, how to report a vulnerability, what information to include, and what to expect after you report.

## Supported Versions

We use semantic versioning for releases. Only the listed versions will receive security patches and coordinated disclosure support.

| Version     | Supported?          |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `v2025-modernised` (latest) | :white_check_mark: |
| `v0.1.0` (2025-09-xx)       | :white_check_mark: |
| `v2011-legacy`              | :x:                |

> **Note:** `v2011-legacy` is a preserved historical snapshot and will **not** receive security fixes. If you depend on older code, please plan to upgrade to the modernised tag.
