# Latest News Headlines Sentiment Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project collects **news headlines**, performs **sentiment analysis**, and presents trends and insights through dashboards or visual reports. The goal is to help stakeholders see how public sentiment evolves across news topics over time.

## ðŸ—“ Timeline  
- **Start Date:** [Jan 2025]  
- **Completion / Update:** [Apr 2025]  

## ðŸ§° Features & Capabilities  
- Fetch recent headlines (via news API or web scraping)  
- Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, lowercasing, stopwords)  
- Sentiment scoring (polarity, subjectivity or classification)  
- Trend analysis over time (daily, weekly, monthly aggregation)  
- Dashboard / visual output (plots, charts)  
- REST API endpoints (e.g., `/health`, `/predict`) for integration

ðŸ“ˆ Metrics & Results
Included is a snapshot of model performance saved to metrics/metrics.csv:

Run Date	Dataset	Split	Model	Metric (e.g. accuracy)	Notes
2025-04-01	news_headlines	test	BaselineModel	0.78	Demo row

Other outputs (plots, dashboards) are saved in the dashboards/ folder. See sample screenshot:

ðŸŽ¯ Modernization & Ethical Note
This project was built freshly in 2025 with modern standards:

Reproducible Python pipelines, modular code

REST API for integration

Metrics logged automatically for transparency

Anonymisation and privacy best practices applied to any proprietary data

Simulated streaming mode included (for environments without full live data access)

ðŸ§ª Testing & CI
Run tests via:

bash
Copy code
pytest
Continuous integration ensures pipeline runs, metrics are generated, and endpoints respond correctly.
